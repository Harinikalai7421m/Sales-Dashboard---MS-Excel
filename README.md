This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive and visually appealing Sales Dashboard in Excel. The dashboard provides key insights into sales trends, regional performance, and product category analysis. The purpose is to enable data-driven decision-making by presenting essential business metrics in a simplified and user-friendly manner.

The Pivot table is created.
Sales by category:

I created a sales dashboard in Excel to analyze sales by category using a pivot table. In this dashboard, the sub-category is placed in rows, the sum of sales in values, and a line chart is used to visualize the data effectively.

### Result:
The sales dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key sales metrics, including sales performance by category, monthly sales trends, and the top 5 customers contributing to revenue.
